# express-ts-mobx-template
Publishing this mainly for myself to use later. It's not documented or friendly to others. But it uses
- Node + typescript + Express for server
- PSQL + TypeORM for the databse
- react-app + Mobx + Typescript for client 

And it's ready to deploy to Heroku! 

TO DO:
- Add React Router on the client
